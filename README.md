# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis


## Introduction

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to provide insights into the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) across different regions. The dashboard visualizes data on various EV models, their distribution by state and city, and key attributes such as electric range and manufacturer. This analysis aims to support policy-making, market research, and the promotion of sustainable transportation.

## Dashboard Analysis

The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the electric vehicle landscape, focusing on:

- **EV Distribution**: Analyze the geographic distribution of electric vehicles by county and city.
- **Vehicle Characteristics**: Explore details such as vehicle make, model, type, and electric range.
- **Market Trends**: Identify trends in EV adoption, including popular manufacturers and models.
- **Legislative and Utility Information**: Examine legislative districts and electric utility providers associated with EV owners.

## Features

- **Geographic Analysis**:
  - Visualize the distribution of electric vehicles across various regions, including state, county, and city levels.
  - Interactive maps allow users to drill down into specific areas to understand EV adoption patterns.

- **Vehicle Type and Range**:
  - Analyze the types of electric vehicles (Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)) and their electric ranges.
  - Explore which vehicle types and models are most popular in different regions.

- **Manufacturer Insights**:
  - View the distribution of EVs by manufacturer (e.g., Tesla, BMW, Nissan).
  - Identify top-selling models and their market share.

- **Legislative Districts and Utilities**:
  - Examine the legislative districts associated with EV ownership.
  - Analyze which electric utility providers serve the regions with the highest EV adoption.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key columns:

- **VIN (1-10)**: The first 10 characters of the vehicle identification number.
- **County**: County where the vehicle is registered.
- **City**: City where the vehicle is registered.
- **State**: State where the vehicle is registered.
- **Postal Code**: Postal code of the vehicle's registration location.
- **Model Year**: Year the vehicle was manufactured.
- **Make**: Manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Tesla, Nissan).
- **Model**: Specific model of the vehicle.
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Type of electric vehicle (e.g., BEV, PHEV).
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**: Indicates whether the vehicle is eligible for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives.
- **Electric Range**: The maximum range of the vehicle on a single charge.
- **Base MSRP**: Manufacturer's suggested retail price for the vehicle.
- **Legislative District**: Legislative district associated with the vehicleâ€™s registration.
- **DOL Vehicle ID**: Unique vehicle ID assigned by the Department of Licensing.
- **Vehicle Location**: Geographic coordinates of the vehicle's registration location.
- **Electric Utility**: Electric utility provider for the vehicle's location.
- **2020 Census Tract**: Census tract information based on the 2020 Census.
